# Gymnasiearbete - CropFactorCalculator

## Disclaimer

This is a school project. No shade is meant to be thrown at other tools of similar nature. It is simply for the sake of argument, and is necessary for this assignment.

## Todo

&#9744; Prettify calculator output

&#9745; Add csv parsing to client (removes need for backend api)

&#9744; Get rid of create-react-app (possibly move to new repo)

&#9744; Add lens modifier support (focal reducer/teleconverter)

&#9744; Write a proper readme

&#9744; Make the site look somewhat good

&#9744; Switch from class components to functional components + hooks

&#9744; Switch to typescript

&#9744; Simplify code (?)
